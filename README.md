Computer Vision Practice and Projects Repository
Welcome to the Computer Vision Practice and Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of files and projects that I have been working on to learn and practice computer vision techniques. I will update this README as I continue to work on new projects and improve my skills.

Practice Directory
The Practice directory in this repository contains a variety of files and notebooks that I've used for hands-on learning and experimentation with computer vision concepts. These practice materials are organized into subdirectories based on specific topics or techniques, making it easy to explore and review my learning journey.

Feel free to explore the Practice directory to see my progress and the techniques I've been practicing. The files in this section may include:

Jupyter Notebooks with code and explanations
Python scripts for image processing and analysis
Sample datasets for experimentation
Documentation and resources I've used during my learning process
Projects
The Projects directory is where I showcase my practical applications of computer vision. In this section, you'll find more structured and complete projects that demonstrate my ability to apply computer vision techniques to real-world problems. Each project may include:

Detailed project descriptions
Code for image processing and computer vision algorithms
Sample input and output images
Evaluation metrics and results
As I work on new projects, I will update this section with links to project-specific READMEs and code repositories, providing more in-depth information about each project.

Contributions
If you find any of my work interesting or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. I welcome collaboration and feedback from the community to enhance my understanding of computer vision and improve the quality of my projects.
